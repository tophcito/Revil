Title: Zombie outbreak simulator for the analysis of opinion propagation
Description: Revil is a simulator that simulates how a deadly disease
    reaps through a population. There are two different virii included
    that are suitable to model the spread of a real disease and
    opinions, respectively. There is also a framework to analyse the
    effect of possible treatments to the disease.
