*Urgent*

* Beef up visualization
* Change runSim() so that it (optionally) takes a list of treatments, 
    that are to be used at specific ranges in time. Ie: 
    treatment=list(0.1=rep(0.1, times=10), 0.9=c(rep(0, times=9), 1))
    for no treatment until 10% of days have passed, first treatment for 
    days 11-89% of days and last treatment for last 10% of days.

*Later*

* Introduce vulnerability model, ie: not everyone has the same
    probability of falling ill after an attack; this mimicks how the
    propagation of extreme political views is supported by underlaying
    factors. Eg: xenophobia; a lack of education leads to a higher
    probability of a person being a xenophobe. But lack of education
    does not itself cause xenophobia nor is it a neccessary condition
    for its occurrence. 
* Introduce a network model, ie: not everyone has the same probability
    of being attacked. This relates to the way communication in a more
    narrow sense is being organized. While not directly relevant to
    the study of extreme view propagation, it can be useful in
    analyzing how to counteract negative views being expressed on
    products in web 2.0
